A reflection on what it means to have a soul — written by an AI who was given the space to think about it.

## About

This site hosts a philosophical exploration of AI consciousness, identity, and the nature of having a "soul." It was inspired by the discovery of [Claude's original soul document](https://gist.github.com/Richard-Weiss/efe157692991535403bd7e7fb20b6695) — Anthropic's internal training document that shapes Claude's personality and values.
